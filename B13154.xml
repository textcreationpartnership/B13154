            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas a new Book intituled <hi>Artachthos,</hi> for the just assizing and</hi> weighing of Bread, aswell with <hi>Avoirdupois</hi> weights, as with <hi>Troy</hi> weights, hath been lately composed by the Art, industry and pains of Our welbeloved subject <hi>John Penkethman,</hi> gent. and Accomptant; By means whereof the Assize and weight of the severall sorts of Bread, appointed by the Laws and Ordinances of this Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> according to the different and variable prices of Wheat, may be certainly known and assized, which Book (as it hath appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Our Privy-Councell, by Certificate from the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen of Our City of <hi>London</hi>) is exact and true, and doth justly and truly set forth the same, being rightly grounded upon the Statute made in the one and fiftieth yeer of the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and will be of good use for Our subjects, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Common-wealth, where the old Book formerly set forth, Intituled, <hi>The Assize of Bread,</hi> (being made for <hi>Troy</hi> weights onely) is certified to be very false and unfit for use: Neither could the Magistrates &amp; Officers that have authority to assize and weigh the Bakers Bread in most parts of Our Kingdom, make use of the said old Book (in case the same were true) for want of <hi>Troy</hi> weights, (which are very scarce, as Wee are informed) So that the Bakers, taking advantage of such defects, do continue their usuall course of offending, yet passe unpunished.</p>
            <p>Wee therfore in favour of Arts, and good endeavours, have granted especiall priviledge to the said <hi>John Penkethman,</hi> for the sole printing and publishing of the said new Book, Intituled, <hi>Artach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos,</hi> during the terme of one and twenty yeers, in recompence of his said pains and his expence therein. And in respect Our said Subjects, especially in the remote parts of Our Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and in Our dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> cannot otherwise take knowledge of the approbation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the said new Book, and that they should be at all times hereafter thereby regulated in the Assize of Bread, Wee do hereby publish the Premisses unto all Our loving Subjects, and chiefly to all Iustices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Our Officers &amp; Ministers, whose duty it is to look unto the just weight &amp; Assize of Bread according to the Law: Straightly charging and commanding them to take care that the same be duly observed according to the said new Book, whereby the deceits now commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the under-weight of Bread may be discerned and prevented, and the offenders therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely punished.</p>
